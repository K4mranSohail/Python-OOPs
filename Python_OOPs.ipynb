        "\n",
        " - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Abstraction and Encapsulation are two fundamental concepts that help in building efficient and secure software. Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of an object to the user. It focuses on what an object does, rather than how it does it, allowing the user to interact with the functionality without knowing the internal complexity. For example, when driving a car, the driver simply uses the steering wheel and pedals without understanding the internal mechanism of the engine. In Python, abstraction is often achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. On the other hand, Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components to protect sensitive data. This is done by using access modifiers like private (__) or protected (_) to prevent unauthorized access to variables and methods. For instance, in an ATM machine, the user can perform transactions without directly accessing the backend code. Encapsulation helps in data security, code reusability, and better control over the data flow. In summary, abstraction focuses on hiding complexity, while encapsulation focuses on protecting data."
